# zsh
Why you should use zsh?
* Automatic cd: Just type the directory name
* Recursive path expansion: For example "/ u / lo / b" expands "/ usr / local / bin"
* Spelling Correction: If you make some mistake in typing a directory name, ZSH will fix it for you
* Plugin and Theme Support: For example "Oh-my-zsh"
