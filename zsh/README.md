# zsh

## Description

[Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language

[Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is my plugin manager and this file work only with it

## Why you should use zsh?

* Automatic cd: Just type the directory name
* Recursive path expansion: For example "/ u / lo / b" expands "/ usr / local / bin"
* Spelling Correction: If you make some mistake in typing a directory name, ZSH will fix it for you
* Plugin and Theme Support: For example "Oh-my-zsh"
